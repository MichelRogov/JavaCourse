In order to run test under Intellij you need:

1. Got to File -> Project Structure.. -> Modules
    Right click on test folder and chose "Tests"

2. Go to test/src/Stream/Stream_Api/HomeWork -> StreamHWTest
    Move your cursor to @Test annotation and click on it.
    Press ALT + ENTER and chose in context menu Add 'JUnit 4.2' to classpath

    After it you shouldn't see any errors on the page. Anyway, if it is not a case you have to do following:
    Read error description and try to find the answer in google. Try to ask somebody for your group about your error,
    maybe somebody has resolved it already. Try to google again. Only in case, if you did all steps and google and
    your teammates didn't help you, write me in skype, and i will try to find time to help you.
