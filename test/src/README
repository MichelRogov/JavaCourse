In order to run test under Intellij you need:

1. Got to File -> Project Structure.. -> Modules
    Right click on test folder and chose "Tests"

2. Go to test/src/Stream/Stream_Api/HomeWork -> StreamHWTest
    Move your cursor to @Test annotation and click on it.
    Press ALT + ENTER and chose in context menu Add 'JUnit 4.2' to classpath

    After it you shouldn't see any errors on the page. Anyway, if it's not a case do following:
    Read error description and try to find the answer in google. Ask somebody for help in your group,
    maybe somebody has resolved it already. Try to use google again. Only in case, if you did all this steps and nothing
    didn't help you, write me in skype.
